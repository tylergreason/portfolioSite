            <h1 class='intro__details__header'>Hi, I'm Tyler Greason</h1>
            <div class='intro__details__bio'>My background is in commercial building energy efficiency, which taught me to approach problems holistically and to always strive for efficiency. When programming just as a hobby stopped sufficing my desire to create, I took the plunge and joined Flatiron School's immersive software engineering program to become a full stack web developer. 
                <br>
                I enjoy writing clean, efficient, and functional code. I am happiest working on the front end, creating a user experience that is as much a pleasure to look at as it is to use. Check out my latest project here:

                <div class='details__desc'>Stuff To Do Map was created as my final project for Flatiron School’s Immersive Software Engineering program. I was inspired to create it after traveling abroad in the summer of 2019. As I was journeying to new cities and looking online for things to do, I found a lack of sites that let me find things to do around my current location. I wanted to see a map, know where I was, and know what was around me, without having to wade through multiple listacles and look up addresses myself. Thus, Stuff To Do Map was born.</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Utilized LeafletJS and OpenStreetMap to quickly create a fully-featured and customizable map.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Designed so users can create their own attractions, which can be rated by other users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrated OpenTripMap historical district data to ensure there was something to do in any location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed with React Redux for more DRY code, drastically increasing development speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Used a Heroku-hosted Rails backend to make API calls, reducing the work done by the client’s machine.
                    </li>

                <div class='details__desc'>Work It Out was made for my third project for Flatiron School’s Immersive Software Engineering program. I wanted to build an application to track workouts that allowed me to easily copy old workout routines into a new field, make small edits, and create a new instance of that workout routine. I love to work out and do so weekly. I usually repeat workout routines each week with small variations, so the ability to quickly make copies of and edits to old workout routines seemed exciting and a great way to show my functional programming knowledge.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Designed using BEM methodology for easily readable and maintainable CSS.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Utilized SASS for quick development time and to ensure cross-browser functionality.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Written using MVC design pattern, separating view responsibilities on the frontend from model and controller responsibilities on the backend.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Frontend written using functional programming, keeping the code DRY and reusable.

                <div class='details__desc'>Art Forum was created to exemplify my understanding of Ruby on Rails and proper web application construction, including proper routing, use of views, models, and controllers, and web page design. Art Forum was used for my mod 2 project during my time in Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering program.
                    The intent behind Art Forum was to make an application that could connect art lovers to each other. Each day a new image from The Metropolitan Museum of Art's API is added to the site's collection of images. Users are able to comment on images and add images to their list of favorite images. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Implemented Metropolitan Museum of Art’s API to present pieces of art and their details to users.

                            Designed using coolors.co to find an appealing color palette that left the art as the focus of each page.
